Professional\narchitecture firms and offices no longer specialize in building design only;\nthey have expanded into related fields that compel architecture education to\nbecome more comprehensive and advanced than ever.\n\nStudents can both complete the accredited architecture degree\n[https://design.asu.edu/about/accreditation] content and gain additional\ncredentials for another master's degree or certificate that supports their\nindividual interests. This enables students to pursue concurrent options in\nrelated areas, such as construction management, sustainability, real estate\ndevelopment, urban planning, landscape architecture, interior architecture,\nbusiness and other subject areas. Students also may simultaneously join other\nprograms across ASU such as health, education or fine arts.\n\nEach semester of the program includes a design studio and two other courses,\nsuch as technology, representation, history, theory, research and practice.\nStudents craft the design and plan the construction of economically and\necologically sustainable built environments and communities. They are rigorously\ntrained on advanced design and digital prototyping, innovative building systems\nand new technologies, as well as in the research and advocacy of the expansive\npublic role of architects within a broader civic dialogue and social justice\naspirations.\n\nThe program is offered in two distinct learning modalities --- in-person and\nonline --- providing further opportunities for students to earn the same\nNational Architectural Accrediting Board-accredited professional degree.\n\nStudents who successfully complete the requirements for Master of Architecture\nprogram and their chosen electives for their certificate can choose to continue\nfor an additional year in their added field and turn their certificate into the\nsecond master's degree. Students pursuing concurrent degrees earn two distinct\ndegrees and receive two diplomas, allowing them to pursue their own personal or\nprofessional interests effectively.\n\nThe mission of The Design School is to prepare students for professional\nsuccess, while continuing to innovate and advance the discipline of architecture\nthrough an emphasis on place, context and contemporary culture; this emphasis\nrecognizes the school's responsibility and commitment to social and\nenvironmental justice within Arizona, the region, nation and the world.\n\nThe Design School in the ASU Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts offers\nthe following NAAB-accredited degree program:\n\n * Master of Architecture, two-year track (preprofessional degree + 48 graduate\n   credit hours)\n * Master of Architecture, three-year track (non-preprofessional degree + 72\n   credit hours)\n\nNext accreditation visit: 2023\nAccredited since: 1985",

In\ntheoretically and methodologically rigorous courses taught by experienced\nfaculty from various disciplines, students develop understanding of how social\njustice and human rights issues are defined by multiple and intersecting forms\nof inequality and social identity, including gender, race, ethnicity, class,\nsexuality and nationality.\n\nMany students complete internships domestically or internationally, with interns\ntypically working alongside other researchers and advocates for social justice\nin order to grasp the complexities of the issues and to hone their abilities to\nwork effectively in both research and advocacy contexts. Internships may also\ninform the basis of the culminating experience: a traditional Master of Arts\nthesis, an applied project or a capstone course.\n\nStudents gain deeper insight into the theory and practice of social justice,\nhuman rights and humanitarian efforts, and they develop practical skills in\nresearch and grant writing.",

The doctorate in comparative culture and language\nfocuses particularly on research questions and themes that cannot be fully\nexplored within the traditional disciplinary boundaries; instead, it fosters\ndynamic collaboration across disciplines in order to engage in the production of\nknowledge that is crucial to understanding transnational and transcultural\ninteractions across time and space.\n\nThe program offers the opportunity to pursue, with the guidance of faculty who\nare comparatists and specialists in particular fields, transdisciplinary\nresearch and teaching. In consultation with their advisor, students do their\ncoursework in a primary and a secondary area of emphasis. Both areas are\norganized around interdisciplinary study and research in more than one language;\nstudents are expected to have advanced proficiency in one language other than\nEnglish (this is the language of primary emphasis) and at least reading\nknowledge in a second language other than English (language of secondary\nemphasis).\n\nFor example, a student might choose to study medieval European theater for the\nprimary area of emphasis and medieval book culture for the secondary area. For\nthe primary area of emphasis, then, the student could demonstrate advanced\nproficiency in one European language, such as French or Italian, depending on\nthe requirements of their research. Then, for the second language other than\nEnglish, the student would have at least reading knowledge, say, of Latin.\nAnother example: The student chooses to study the representation of the migrant\nexperience in contemporary East Asian cultures as the primary area of emphasis,\nand film and media studies as the secondary area. Their primary area of emphasis\nwould require advanced proficiency in a certain East Asian language, such as\nChinese, Japanese or Korean, and the secondary area reading knowledge of one\nmore non-English language, pertinent to their comparative research.\n\nFaculty members are drawn from the School of International Letters and Cultures\nand other programs in the humanities and social sciences across Arizona State\nUniversity.",

It emphasizes that major health\nchallenges stem from many factors well beyond disease itself --- factors that\nare cultural, ecological, evolutionary, historical, institutional, social and\ntechnological.\n\nAny effective, sustainable solutions to the most pressing global health\nchallenges need to take all these factors into account, including the complex\nways in which they relate to each other. In this manner, this degree program\nteaches students to understand health challenges not simply as a product of\ndisease, but as emerging in the contexts of complex and interrelated ecology,\npolitics, history, culture, social institutions and evolutionary biology. It\nalso places primacy on how to address the broader bases of ill health (i.e.,\nstructural, cultural) in complicated, ever-changing health challenges in\nlow-resource community settings and a globalizing world. To do this, the program\ncombines social and life science theories with on-the-ground research and its\napplication. There is a strong emphasis on collaborative action as key to\nidentifying and addressing global health problems in a sustainable and\nmeaningful way.\n\nStudents accepted to the program are tied to ongoing transdisciplinary global\nhealth projects that address complicated, multifaceted health challenges that\ndefy easy fixes, such as climate change-related diseases, emerging infectious\ndiseases and obesity.\n\nBy applying a collaborative, problem-solving format, the master's degree program\nin global health is intended to provide those planning to enter health or\nrelated fields (i.e., environmental, social) with the transdisciplinary\norientation, team skills and social and cultural acuity that the Pew Health\nProfessions Commission, among others, has identified as critical but lacking in\ncurrent health workforce training.

When undetected and untreated, whether in primary care or other\nmedical settings, the results are poor clinical outcomes and increased medical\ncosts related to overuse of medical services. A key recommendation in health\ncare reform is improved integration of medical and behavioral care in order to\nboth improve health outcomes as well as decrease health care costs.\n\nThe doctoral curriculum is explicitly focused on graduating experts who can both\nspeak the language of evidence-based clinical interventions and to perform cost\nsavings and return on investment analyses that are in high demand in new models\nof accountable care delivery. Traditional doctoral training does not prepare\nclinicians or managers with the interdisciplinary knowledge required to meet\nthese new demands in the health care marketplace. This program reflects a\nparadigm shift to a curriculum based on business entrepreneurship skills, such\nas business plans, marketing and returns on investment specific to health care;\nevidence-based behavioral interventions for primary care that are efficient and\ncontribute to cost savings by reducing unnecessary medical care services and\ncosts; health care systems policies, economics and finance that respond to\nemerging opportunities in health care reform; and medical literacy, to\nunderstand common medical conditions seen in primary care and consult\neffectively with the medical team.\n\nThe curriculum is unique in that it incorporates internship experiences in\nprimary care or similar medical settings, and it integrates clinical and\nprofessional affiliated faculty as well as faculty associates who are experts\nand are directly employed in health care environments in the area that they are\nteaching. It is a flexible, online degree program that enables students to\nselect a program of study ranging from part-time to full-time attendance, and it\nis available through ASU Online as a distance-learning program. The program\noffers either a clinical track for licensed clinicians or a management track for\nhealth care managers and leaders, and it replaces the dissertation with a\nculminating research project that combines an applied research study with a\nbusiness plan.\n\nInternship experiences are arranged with local site liaisons, and students meet\nin small groups with a doctoral consultant who leads case reviews and studies.\nRural health and experiences with disadvantaged and multicultural populations\nare encouraged.\n\nGraduates of the program will lead a societal transformation by increasing\naccess to behavioral care, integrating behavioral providers into medical teams,\nimproving patient outcomes and satisfaction, and decreasing cost of care.",

They have multiple opportunities to\nvirtually share their ongoing research throughout each academic year.\n\nLeader-Scholar Communities, formed at the end of the first year and consisting\nof six to seven students and one faculty member, meet regularly for the second\nand third years of the program to supply academic and personal support. Through\nthese communities, students support each other, under faculty guidance, in the\nconceptualization, implementation and study of change initiatives. Each\nstudent's community leader serves as the dissertation chair, along with two\nadditional committee members who ultimately make up the doctoral committee.\n\nSuccessful graduates make a commitment to continuing systematic study of their\nprofessional practice and sustaining innovation and leadership by making a\npositive difference in their local settings. The program aims to enable more\nthoughtful, intentional and informed leaders who are willing and able to\nimplement and study continuous improvement.\n\nThe program makes a difference in the way a student thinks and works as a leader\nin education for the immediate and local benefit of school children, adult\nlearners, schools or other organizations, and local communities.\n\nThe program is not designed to prepare students for academic research-oriented\ntenure-track positions.",
