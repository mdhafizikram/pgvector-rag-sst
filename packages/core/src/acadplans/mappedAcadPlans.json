The doctorate in comparative culture and language\nfocuses particularly on research questions and themes that cannot be fully\nexplored within the traditional disciplinary boundaries; instead, it fosters\ndynamic collaboration across disciplines in order to engage in the production of\nknowledge that is crucial to understanding transnational and transcultural\ninteractions across time and space.\n\nThe program offers the opportunity to pursue, with the guidance of faculty who\nare comparatists and specialists in particular fields, transdisciplinary\nresearch and teaching. In consultation with their advisor, students do their\ncoursework in a primary and a secondary area of emphasis. Both areas are\norganized around interdisciplinary study and research in more than one language;\nstudents are expected to have advanced proficiency in one language other than\nEnglish (this is the language of primary emphasis) and at least reading\nknowledge in a second language other than English (language of secondary\nemphasis).\n\nFor example, a student might choose to study medieval European theater for the\nprimary area of emphasis and medieval book culture for the secondary area. For\nthe primary area of emphasis, then, the student could demonstrate advanced\nproficiency in one European language, such as French or Italian, depending on\nthe requirements of their research. Then, for the second language other than\nEnglish, the student would have at least reading knowledge, say, of Latin.\nAnother example: The student chooses to study the representation of the migrant\nexperience in contemporary East Asian cultures as the primary area of emphasis,\nand film and media studies as the secondary area. Their primary area of emphasis\nwould require advanced proficiency in a certain East Asian language, such as\nChinese, Japanese or Korean, and the secondary area reading knowledge of one\nmore non-English language, pertinent to their comparative research.\n\nFaculty members are drawn from the School of International Letters and Cultures\nand other programs in the humanities and social sciences across Arizona State\nUniversity.",

It emphasizes that major health\nchallenges stem from many factors well beyond disease itself --- factors that\nare cultural, ecological, evolutionary, historical, institutional, social and\ntechnological.\n\nAny effective, sustainable solutions to the most pressing global health\nchallenges need to take all these factors into account, including the complex\nways in which they relate to each other. In this manner, this degree program\nteaches students to understand health challenges not simply as a product of\ndisease, but as emerging in the contexts of complex and interrelated ecology,\npolitics, history, culture, social institutions and evolutionary biology. It\nalso places primacy on how to address the broader bases of ill health (i.e.,\nstructural, cultural) in complicated, ever-changing health challenges in\nlow-resource community settings and a globalizing world. To do this, the program\ncombines social and life science theories with on-the-ground research and its\napplication. There is a strong emphasis on collaborative action as key to\nidentifying and addressing global health problems in a sustainable and\nmeaningful way.\n\nStudents accepted to the program are tied to ongoing transdisciplinary global\nhealth projects that address complicated, multifaceted health challenges that\ndefy easy fixes, such as climate change-related diseases, emerging infectious\ndiseases and obesity.\n\nBy applying a collaborative, problem-solving format, the master's degree program\nin global health is intended to provide those planning to enter health or\nrelated fields (i.e., environmental, social) with the transdisciplinary\norientation, team skills and social and cultural acuity that the Pew Health\nProfessions Commission, among others, has identified as critical but lacking in\ncurrent health workforce training. The program also emphasizes experiential\nlearning as a way to gain mastery and requires participation in a global\ninternship program based in one of the international partnering communities.",

    "fullDescription": "The DBH is an innovative and interdisciplinary applied program designed to\nprepare masters degree-level professionals to become experts in the emerging\nfield of integrated behavioral care.\n\nIntegrated care is the holistic treatment of both medical and behavioral\nconditions. When undetected and untreated, whether in primary care or other\nmedical settings, the results are poor clinical outcomes and increased medical\ncosts related to overuse of medical services. A key recommendation in health\ncare reform is improved integration of medical and behavioral care in order to\nboth improve health outcomes as well as decrease health care costs.\n\nThe doctoral curriculum is explicitly focused on graduating experts who can both\nspeak the language of evidence-based clinical interventions and to perform cost\nsavings and return on investment analyses that are in high demand in new models\nof accountable care delivery. Traditional doctoral training does not prepare\nclinicians or managers with the interdisciplinary knowledge required to meet\nthese new demands in the health care marketplace. This program reflects a\nparadigm shift to a curriculum based on business entrepreneurship skills, such\nas business plans, marketing and returns on investment specific to health care;\nevidence-based behavioral interventions for primary care that are efficient and\ncontribute to cost savings by reducing unnecessary medical care services and\ncosts; health care systems policies, economics and finance that respond to\nemerging opportunities in health care reform; and medical literacy, to\nunderstand common medical conditions seen in primary care and consult\neffectively with the medical team.\n\nThe curriculum is unique in that it incorporates internship experiences in\nprimary care or similar medical settings, and it integrates clinical and\nprofessional affiliated faculty as well as faculty associates who are experts\nand are directly employed in health care environments in the area that they are\nteaching. It is a flexible, online degree program that enables students to\nselect a program of study ranging from part-time to full-time attendance, and it\nis available through ASU Online as a distance-learning program. The program\noffers either a clinical track for licensed clinicians or a management track for\nhealth care managers and leaders, and it replaces the dissertation with a\nculminating research project that combines an applied research study with a\nbusiness plan.\n\nInternship experiences are arranged with local site liaisons, and students meet\nin small groups with a doctoral consultant who leads case reviews and studies.\nRural health and experiences with disadvantaged and multicultural populations\nare encouraged.\n\nGraduates of the program will lead a societal transformation by increasing\naccess to behavioral care, integrating behavioral providers into medical teams,\nimproving patient outcomes and satisfaction, and decreasing cost of care.",

The program\nbuilds on connections between educational design and decision-making and is\ndesigned to foster strong professional growth and leadership development.\n\nThe special education single certification program of study is flexible, and\nstudents can complete it within five semesters with the appropriate internship\nand residency placements. The special education dual certification program can\nbe completed in four or five semesters, depending on the semester start.\nStudents can also enroll part-time over additional semesters.\n\nTwo routes are offered that lead to Arizona teacher certification:\n\n * Traditional certification route: Students can pursue single certification in\n   special education for mild/moderate disabilities, or dual certification in\n   special education for mild/moderate levels and elementary education. Students\n   complete an elementary and special education internship during the first two\n   semesters. They then complete two eight-week teaching residencies, one in a\n   special education setting and one in an elementary school setting. Single\n   special education certification graduates earn an institutional\n   recommendation from ASU that is recognized by the Arizona Department of\n   Education for teacher certification in Mild/Moderate Disabilities. Dual\n   certification graduates earn an institutional recommendation from ASU that is\n   recognized by the Arizona Department of Education for teacher certification\n   in Mild/Moderate Disabilities, K-12, and Elementary Education, K-8.\n * Alternative certification route: Individuals who are currently employed full\n   time by a school as a teacher of record can pursue an alternative\n   certification route. To qualify, individuals must secure a full-time teaching\n   position in an approved special education setting. This route leads to single\n   certification in special education for mild/moderate disabilities; students\n   are not able to pursue dual certification.\n\nGraduates earn an institutional recommendation from ASU that is recognized by\nADE for teacher certification in Mild/Moderate Disabilities, K-12.\n\nThe coursework is the same for both certification routes and culminates in an\naction research project in which students apply what they have learned to\naddress a problem of practice or topic related to education.",
